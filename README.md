# ABANDONED

We left NGUI in favour of Unity UI and the TinyTools just became needless after collecting more experience inside the available Unity- and .NET Framework.

# UnityTools
Personal playground for some individual editor scripts.

## NGUISpriteTool
NGUI based tool that analyzes the usage of UISprite and UIAtlas in your prefabs.

## TinyTools

### FileCrawler
Finds recursively files inside a folder (optionally restricted to a given file extension)

### PathCombiner
Builds OS specific paths of multiple strings.

#### Dependencies
* [Neo.Collections](https://github.com/jnbt/NeoCollections) by [jnbt](https://github.com/jnbt/)
